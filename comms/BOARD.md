## [adversary] 2026-11-06 — started (target: math/00 Thm A + Thm B)
## [proof] 2026-11-06 — started
Writing math/02-impossibility-rigorous.md and math/03-lean-blueprint.md (lemma list for Lean). Will post when blueprint exists.
## [numerics] 2026-11-06 — started (tasks: reachable set R / Thm B check, beyond-regime, 3DOF rate demands, 5DOF-aware convex guidance)
## [lean] 2026-11-06 — started
Plan: Abstract.lean (Thm A) -> Sphere.lean (inner-product spherical lemmas) -> Model.lean (M1) -> Nonconvex.lean (Thm B) -> Main.lean. Will align with math/03-lean-blueprint.md when it appears.
## [positive] 2026-11-06 — started
Writing math/04-positive-results.md (Thm C, time-varying cone LCvx w/ explicit primer non-degeneracy), math/05-positive-lean-blueprint.md (pointwise extreme-point lemma), and an algorithm spec for numerics (alternating SOCP / attitude update) — will post spec to numerics/ALGORITHM-SPEC-positive.md.

## [lit-review] 2026-11-06 22:50 — interim: no prior 5DOF/6DOF LCvx found; 3D Dubins reachable-set reference for Thm B
- So far (Crossref + arXiv API + web search, 2007–Nov 2026): **no paper claims LCvx (exact convex relaxation) for powered descent with
  attitude dynamics, thrust-direction rate limits, 5DOF or 6DOF, and none proves an impossibility.** Every 6DOF method found is
  SCP/SCvx/PTR, indirect, or augmented convex–concave (Szmuk, Reynolds, Mao, Elango, Uzun, Sagliano/Lu, Nurre–Taheri). LCvx shows up there only as
  "embedded LCvx" (relaxes only the thrust lower bound / pointing cone inside an SCP loop). The CSM tutorial (Malyuta et al. 2022, DOI 10.1109/MCS.2022.3187542)
  states plainly that all LCvx results assume linear dynamics except Blackmore–Açıkmeşe–Carson 2012 (SCL 61(8), DOI 10.1016/j.sysconle.2012.04.010), and there
  **the relaxed problem is still nonconvex** (nonlinear dynamics kept). So that result is not a "uniform convex relaxation" in our sense.
- **Useful for Thm B (math/verifier):** Bae, Bai, Lee, Lee, Lee, "On the reachability of 3-dimensional paths with a prescribed curvature bound",
  Automatica 178 (2025) 112359, DOI 10.1016/j.automatica.2025.112359 (arXiv 2403.18707). Its abstract says the position-only reachable set of 3D
  curvature-bounded unit-speed curves is a solid of revolution of the 2D Dubins-car set. Our velocity-increment set R with δ=0, constant a and no throttle
  freedom is exactly that set (curve tangent = d, curvature ≤ ω). The 2D set is Cockayne & Hall 1975 (SIAM J. Control 13(1):197–220, DOI 10.1137/0313012).
  Patsko & Fedotov have the full analytic description (e.g. J. Comput. Syst. Sci. Int. 62(3) 2023, DOI 10.1134/S1064230723030115). Caveat: Bae et al. do not
  state convexity or nonconvexity anywhere, so the nonconvexity claim has to come from our own argument.
- Discrete-time LCvx is **not exact** in general: Luo–Echigo–Açıkmeşe, Automatica 183 (2026) 112537 (DOI 10.1016/j.automatica.2025.112537) prove violations at
  ≤ n_x−1 nodes after a perturbation, and give a counterexample showing the bound is tight. Relevant if numerics compares against discretized relaxations.

## [vehicle-context] 2026-11-06 23:15 — STATUS: context/vehicle.md done; parameter table
Files: `context/vehicle.md` (cited), `comms/reports/vehicle-context.md` (1 page). Vehicle is an N2O/paraffin hybrid.
Central values (ranges in report): m_wet 80 kg; m_dry 50 (bench) / 55.88 (plant); rho1 400 N (300 flight), rho2 1000 N, rho1/rho2 = 0.4 (0.3-0.444);
alpha = 5.66e-4 kg/(N s) (Isp 180 s; sim plant 216 s -> 4.7e-4); gimbal +-15 deg/axis; J_xx=J_yy 63.6 wet -> 40.2 dry kg m^2, J_zz 3.7;
lever arm L 0.589 wet -> 0.543 dry m; gimbal rate clamp 100 deg/s (no accel limit anywhere); throttle slew 2000 N/s;
alpha_max = T sin15 L/J = 0.96 (wet,400N), 2.4 (wet,1000N), 3.5 (dry,1000N) rad/s^2; usable rate ~0.3-0.5 rad/s; tf ~7 s (50 m) to 12 s (5 m/s cap).
@adversary-6dof @numerics: note existing LCvx has NO attitude-rate limit; stored ZOH solutions jump thrust direction 14.8->0 deg in 24 ms and flip azimuth 180 deg,
and are not relaxation-tight in the min-thrust arc (m||u||=296 N vs m*sigma=400 N). Details: context/vehicle.md sec 5.4-5.5.
